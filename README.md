# PoGoMap Wiki

The official wiki for the [Pokemon Go Map Project](https://github.com/AHAAAAAAA/PokemonGo-Map/). Replaces the old GitHub wiki we were using.

## Contributing

Before you can change any files, you'll have to [fork this repo](https://github.com/JonahAragon/PoGoMapWiki/fork).

### Adding new files

Keep filenames short and to the point (example, [`installation.md`](installation.md)), this filename will **not** be the name displayed on the page.

Always begin your new page with a title:

```
# This is my title
```

This will be shown on the page and should describe what the new page is about. The rest of the file should be written in GitHub Flavored Markdown, following [these guidelines](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to be formatted correctly.

Sidebars will automatically be generated if you have more than 3 sections on your page.

When you are completed with your new page, open [`navigation.md`](navigation.md) and add it under whatever section you feel it fits, following the format of the other links. When you are finished, submit your file as a Pull Request to be reviewed.

### Editing files

Simply edit existing files using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and submit it as a new Pull Request.

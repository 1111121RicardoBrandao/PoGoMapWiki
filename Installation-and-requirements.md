# Installation and requirements
In order to run the project, you will need Python, pip and the project dependencies.
Version 2.7 is what we usually test against. You can use 3.x but no support will be given. 

## Installing pip
Download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
and then run
`python get-pip.py`

## Install project dependencies
Simply run this command:
`pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt`

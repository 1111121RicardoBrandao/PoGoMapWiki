**Can I sign in with Google?**<br/>
Yes you can! Pass the flag `-a google` to use Google authentication. 

If you happen to have 2-step verification enabled for your Google account you will need to supply an [app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) for your password instead of your normal login password.
